# Developer Hub Cooperation Internship
**Week 1:**

I set up a Conda environment (ai_ml_env) and installed key libraries. I explored NumPy for array operations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization. I analyzed the Titanic dataset—observing numerical features, handling missing values (mean, mode, median), and visualizing survival distributions. This hands-on approach strengthened my data preprocessing skills, preparing me for upcoming ML tasks.

**Week 2:**

I explored supervised learning by applying Linear Regression to predict housing prices and evaluating performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). For classification, I implemented Logistic Regression on the Iris dataset, refining feature selection and model accuracy.
Using scikit-learn, I practiced key functions such as train_test_split, fit(), predict(), and evaluation metrics like accuracy_score.
Mini-Assignment: Titanic Survival Prediction

As part of my classification task, I built a Logistic Regression model to predict passenger survival rates in the Titanic dataset. I:

✅ Preprocessed data, handling missing values and encoding categorical features.

✅ Trained and evaluated the model using accuracy metrics.

✅ Visualized performance through a confusion matrix and survival distribution plots.
