# Developer Hub Cooperation Internship
**Week 1:**

I set up a Conda environment (ai_ml_env) and installed key libraries. I explored NumPy for array operations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization. I analyzed the Titanic datasetâ€”observing numerical features, handling missing values (mean, mode, median), and visualizing survival distributions. This hands-on approach strengthened my data preprocessing skills, preparing me for upcoming ML tasks.
